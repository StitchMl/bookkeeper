## Riassunto

In this exercise, we will analyze the `createLedger` method of the `org.apache.bookkeeper.client.BookKeeper` class (version 4.16.6), identifying domain partitions for each parameter, and conducting a boundary analysis. We will then formulate 10 prompts for an LLM (4 zero-shots, 4 few-shots, 2 CoT/ToT) and propose preliminary tests with expected results.

## Step 1: Gathering Resources

1. **Official protocol documentation**
   – Visit the 'BookKeeper protocol' page on [http://bookkeeper.apache.org/docs/4.16.6/development/protocol/](http://bookkeeper.apache.org/docs/4.16.6/development/protocol/) to understand the concepts of ledger, ensemble size, write quorum, and ack quorum.
2. **Client Java API**
   – See the Javadoc of the `createLedger` method in version 4.5.1 or later, where the synchronous method is described.
3. **Source code**
   – Retrieve the `BookKeeper.java` class from the GitHub repository (commit `e7430ce...`) to display the exact signature and method overloads.
4. **Enum DigestType**
   – Examine the `DigestType` enumeration for possible values (CRC32, MAC, CRC32C, DUMMY).

## Step 2: Analyzing the signature of the `createLedger` method

Locates the most complete method signature in the `BookKeeper` class (on master or branches close to 4.16.6):

```java
public LedgerHandle createLedger(int ensSize, int writeQuorumSize, int ackQuorumSize,
                                 DigestType digestType, byte[] passwd)
        throws InterruptedException, BKException {
    return createLedger(ensSize, writeQuorumSize, ackQuorumSize, digestType, passwd, Collections.emptyMap());
}
```

– `ensembleSize` (E): number of bookies in the initial ensemble.
– `writeQuorumSize` (Q\_w): size of the writing quorum (≤ E).
– `ackQuorumSize` (Q\_a): ack quorum size (≤ Q\_w).
– `digestType`: checksum type (enum DigestType).
– `password`: array of bytes authenticating the client.

## Step 3: Identifying Domain Partitions

For each parameter you define categories of values (partitions) useful for testing:

| Parameter         | Valid partitions                                          | Invalid partitions                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `ensSize`         | {1; typical values such as 3 or 5; maximum cluster value} | {0; negative; excessively large (>N)} |
| `writeQuorumSize` | {1; E/2 rounded; E}                                       | {0; >E; >ackQuorumSize}               |
| `ackQuorumSize`   | {1; writeQuorumSize/2; writeQuorumSize}                   | {0; >writeQuorumSize}                 |
| `digestType`      | {MAC; CRC32; CRC32C; DUMMY}                               | {null; string invalid in valueOf}     |
| `passwd`          | {0 byte; usual lengths (8-16); maximum length allowed}    | {null; negative length (impossible)}  |

> **Note:** In the documentation, `E ≥ Q\_w ≥ Q\_a` is imposed.

## Step 4: Boundary Analysis

For each partition, it identifies extreme values and boundary neighbors:

* **ensSize**:

    * low borderline: 1 (minimum accepted) and 2 (near a minimum)
    * high borderline: E\_max (number of bookies available) and E\_max+1
* **writeQuorumSize**:

    * 1 (minimum), 2 (close), E (equal to ensembleSize) and E+1 (rejected)
* **ackQuorumSize**:

    * 1, 2, Q\w (equal to writeQuorumSize), Q\w+1 (rejected)
* **digestType**:

    * valid: any of the enum values; invalid: `valueOf("INVALID")` → IllegalArgumentException; `null` → NullPointerException
* **passwd**:

    * empty (`new byte[0]`), typical (`"pass".getBytes()`), very long, `null`.

## Step 5: Prompt Proposal for an LLM

### 5.1 LLM – zero-shot prompting

1. **Prompt ZS-1**

   ```
   As a professional software tester who writes Java test methods, generate a complete JUnit 4 test file (BookKeeperTest.java) to comprehensively test the createLedger method in the following class named BookKeeper.  
   Your output file must start with ###Test START### and finish with ###Test END###.  
   Here is the source code of the method:
   {source_code}
   ```
2. **Prompt ZS-2**

   ```
   You are a QA engineer. Without any examples, produce 12 test cases covering domain partitions and boundary values for the createLedger method of the BookKeeper class (JUnit 4).  
   Output as a single test class file (BookKeeperTest.java) starting with ###Test START### and ending with ###Test END###.  
   Here is the method signature and its JavaDoc:
   {insert JavaDoc/comments here}
    ```
3. **Prompt ZS-3**

   ```
   As a senior tester, design a JUnit 4 test suite for BookKeeper.createLedger that includes valid, invalid and edge‐case scenarios for each parameter.  
   Return exactly one .java file named BookKeeperTest.java, wrapped between ###Test START### and ###Test END### markers.  
   Method signature:
   {source_code}
   ```
4. **Prompt ZS-4**

   ```
   Professional software tester mode: generate 15 JUnit 4 test methods for createLedger in BookKeeper.java.  
   Include domain partitioning, boundary analysis and error-handling scenarios.  
   Provide the complete file BookKeeperTest.java, beginning with ###Test START### and ending with ###Test END###.
   ```

### 5.2 LLM – few-shot prompting

5. **Prompt FS-1**

   ```
   As a professional software tester who writes Java test methods, consider the following examples:
   Example 1:
     Input: (ensembleSize=1, writeQuorumSize=1, ackQuorumSize=1, digestType=MAC, password="p".getBytes())
     Expected: LedgerHandle returned successfully.
   Example 2:
     Input: (ensembleSize=3, writeQuorumSize=4, ackQuorumSize=2, digestType=CRC32, password="pwd".getBytes())
     Expected: IllegalArgumentException (writeQuorumSize > ensembleSize).
   Now, generate a complete JUnit 4 test file (BookKeeperTest.java) that covers all remaining partitions and boundary cases for createLedger.
   Your output must start with ###Test START### and finish with ###Test END###.
   Here is the source code:
   {source_code}
   ```
6. **Prompt FS-2**

   ```
   As a professional software tester, use these samples:
   {fewshot_examples}
   Now produce a full JUnit 4 test suite (BookKeeperTest.java) for the createLedger method, including both valid and invalid scenarios, with clear assertions and exception checks.
   Wrap your answer between ###Test START### and ###Test END###.
   Source code:
   {source_code}
   ```
7. **Prompt FS-3**

   ```
   You are a Java QA expert. Given the two example tests above and the createLedger signature, expand the suite to 12 tests that also cover null digestType, empty password, and maximum ensemble size.  
   Present the entire JUnit 4 file (BookKeeperTest.java), delimited by ###Test START### and ###Test END###.
   Method code:
   {source_code}
   ```
8. **Prompt FS-4**

   ```
   Consider the sample test cases provided:
   {fewshot_examples}
   Generate at least 10 additional JUnit 4 test methods for createLedger, ensuring each domain partition and boundary is exercised exactly once.  
   Deliver one file named BookKeeperTest.java, beginning with ###Test START### and ending with ###Test END###.
   Source:
   {source_code}
   ```

### 5.3 LLM – guided tree-of-thought (CoT/ToT) prompting

9. **Prompt CoT-1**

   ```
   Imagine three software‐testing experts collaborating to build a JUnit 4 suite for BookKeeper.createLedger. They must follow these steps:
   1. Extract and list the parameters with their types.
   2. For each parameter, identify domain partitions.
   3. Determine boundary values for each partition.
   4. Propose one test case per boundary (valid & invalid).
   5. Combine all cases into a single class file.
   At the end, output the complete BookKeeperTest.java file, starting with ###Test START### and ending with ###Test END###.
   Here is the method signature and context:
   {source_code}
   ```

10. **Prompt CoT-2**

```
Using a Tree-of-Thought approach, outline and execute the following for createLedger in BookKeeper.java:
- Step 1: List all five parameters and their constraints.
- Step 2: For each constraint, list valid/invalid partition values.
- Step 3: For each value, draft JUnit 4 assertions or exception expectations.
- Step 4: Assemble these into test methods.
Finally, produce the complete JUnit 4 test file (BookKeeperTest.java) wrapped between ###Test START### and ###Test END###.
Source code:
{source_code}
```

> **Nota:**
>
> * `{source_code}` replace with the code of the complete class or method.
> * `{fewshot_examples}` insert 1–2 test case examples in 'Input/Expected' format to guide the model.

## Step 6: Preliminary Testing Tips

Examples of tests with expected results:

| 6  | (`3,2,1, DUMMY, null`)                    | `NullPointerException` (password null)                       |
| 7  | (`3,2,1, CRC32C, []`)                     | `LedgerHandle` created with an empty password                |
| 8  | (`N_max,N_max,N_max, MAC, pwd`)           | `LedgerHandle` created (maximum ensemble)                    |
| 9  | (`N_max+1,1,1, MAC, pwd`)                 | `IllegalArgumentException` (ensembleSize > max)              |
| 10 | (`3,2,1, DigestType.valueOf("XYZ"), pwd`) | `IllegalArgumentException` (enum non valido)                 |

> Where `pwd` is an array of bytes representing the password, and `N_max` the number of bookies in the cluster.
